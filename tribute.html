        <h2 id="headline"> Here's a timeline of Dr.Kalam's life:</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><b>1931 -</b>Avul Pakir Jainulabdeen Abdul Kalam was born to boat owner, Jainulabudeen, and housewife, Ashiamma, on October 5,1931. He had to seel newspapers during his school days, in order to support his family.</li>
          <li><strong>1960 -</strong>After narrowly missing-out on becoming a fighter-pilot, kalam went on to become a scientist, as he joined the Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO), where he designed a helicopter.</li>
          <li><b>1969 -</b>Kalam, however, was not too convinced about his work at the DRDO, and transferred to the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) .</li>
          <li><b>1970 -</b>In the 1970s, Kalam was also involved in two projects that were sanctioned to build missiles. These projects were reportedly rejected by the Union Cabinet. Prime Minister Indira Gandhi used her discretionary powers to fund these projects secretly. However, these projects were brought to a halt in 1974 (Project Valiant) and in 1980 (Project Devil).</li>
          <li><b>1980 -</b>He became India's first project director to launch a satellite launch vehicle (SLV-III). The ISRO successfully deployed Rohini into the orbit. Rohini lasted for around 20 days in the Earth's orbit.</li>
          <li><b>1980 -</b>Kalam was appointed as the chief executive of the Integrated Guided Missile Development Programme (IGMDP). Under his guidance, different missiles like the Agni, and the Prithvi were developed. However, the IGMDP was criticised later, for mismanagement, and overrunning budgets.</li>
          <li><b>1981 -</b>Due to his incredible work at the ISRO, launching India's first home-made satellite, the Government of India gave him the Padma Bhushan award in the Civil Service category.</li>
          <li><b>1990 -</b>Kalam received the second highest civilian award from the Indian Government, for his works at the ISRO and the DRDO. He was given the Padma Vibhushan award in the Science & Engineering category.</li>
          <li><b>1992-1999 -</b>During this period, Kalam was the Chief Scientific Adviser to Prime Ministers like PV Narasimha Rao and Atal Bihari Vajpayee. The government conducted the Pokhran-II nuclear tests, of which, Kalam served as the Chief Project Coordinator, with R Chidambaram.</li>
          <li><b>1997 -</b>Kalam's achievements were recognised by the Indian Government, as he received the highest civilian award, the Bharat Ratna.</li>
          <li><b>2002 -</b>Kalam won a landslide vote in the Presidential elections, and proceeded to become the first scientist to make it to the Rashtrapati Bhavan. He was also the third Bharat Ratna awardee to become the President.</li>
          <li><b>2003 & 2006 -</b>He was adored for his motivational speeches, and was recognised as the Youth Icon by MTV, in 2003 and 2006.</li>
          <li><b>2007 -</b>After five years in office, when he signed the Office of Profit Bill, and also heard 21 mercy petitions from prisoners who were handed out capital punishment, Kalam finally decided that he would not stand for re-election.</li>
          <li><b>2015 -</b>After collapsing while giving a lecture at IIM Shilong, Abdul Kalam died in a local hospital, leaving behind his lifelong works on aeronautics, space research, missiles, nuclear tests, and of course, being remembered as one of the most popular Presidents of India.</li>
        </ul>
